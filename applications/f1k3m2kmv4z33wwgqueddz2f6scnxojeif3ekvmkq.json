    "Brief history of your project and organization": "This is a public dataset on aws. As a data preparer, we offer assistance to sp in storing meaningful data on filecoin.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Sequence Read Archive (SRA), produced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), stores raw DNA sequencing data and alignment information from high-throughput sequencing platforms. The SRA provides open access to these biological sequence data to support the research community's efforts to enhance reproducibility and make new discoveries by comparing data sets. Buckets in this registry contain public SRA data in the original (user submitted) format from select high value and newly-released studies as well as all public-access SRA formatted ETL+BQS data. Also included is all SRA metadata that can be leveraged for attribute-based data discovery.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We used to learn how to use Lotus and we'll use it to prepare data.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "s3://sra-pub-src-1/\r\ns3://sra-pub-src-2/\r\ns3://sra-pub-run-odp/\r\ns3://sra-pub-metadata-us-east-1/sra/metadata/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01841131 HONGKONG\r\nf02244750 LONDON\r\nf01807908 MADRID\r\nf01879772 HONGKONG\r\nf02363999 SINGAPORE",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
